# Bookstore Web Application

# Project Overview

Welcome to the Bookstore Web Application â€” a dynamic, full-stack e-commerce platform designed to offer users a smooth book-browsing and purchasing experience. This platform enables users to browse a variety of books, manage a shopping cart, make secure payments, and track orders. Administrators can manage inventory, view orders, and handle product listings via an intuitive dashboard.

The application follows the **MERN stack** architecture and is inspired by modern online retail systems, providing user authentication, admin privileges, and API documentation.
